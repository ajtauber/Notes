# React
## Creating a React project
1. Go to terminal and type
`create-react-app <name of your project>`
2. `cd <your project>`
3. `npm start` - starts the server
4. Open it in atom `atom .`

##  Getting Started
1. Create a folder called `components`
2. Move `App.js` in the folder that was created `components`
3. Insert `index.js` file, change `import App from './App';` to
`'./components/App';`  
4. Inside `App.js`       `<FlickrSearch />`





10. `npm install jsonp-es6`, then we write `import jsonp from 'jsonp-es6';` within the `FlickrSearch.js` file




# Routes

`npm install react-router react-router-dom`

* Add a folder called `Components` and move `App.js` within `Components`
* Add another *Page* `Home.js` & `FAQ.js`
* Now we add a `Routes.js`
  *
